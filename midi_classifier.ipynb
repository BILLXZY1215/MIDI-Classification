    "## Introduction\n",
    "Many people like listening to music, and some might be interested in determining\n",
    "the genre of the music that they are listening to. The midi format is a popular music\n",
    "format that can capture many aspects of given music, such as instrument, chord\n",
    "signatures and so on and it is also easy to create midi files using instruments\n",
    "like a portable piano or stage piano, as you could just record your playing and export\n",
    "it in the midi format. Therefore, in this tutorial, I would like to\n",
    "walk through the procedure of extracting features from midi data, matching them with genre labels\n",
    "from the million song dataset and training them on neural networks and SVMs to predict the\n",
    "genres of music, given any midi file.\n",

# Midi Classification Tutorial
This is a tutorial on how to classify music genres using neural networks and support vector machines. It uses the
[The Lakh MIDI Dataset](http://colinraffel.com/projects/lmd/) as well as scikit-learn. It was created as a class
project for the course Practical Data Science (15-388 @ CMU taught by Zico Kolter) during the Spring of 2018.
